        <h3>Welcome to Creatr!</h3>
        <p>Hello and welcome to Creatr! Creatr is an all-in-one tutoring platform built for the modern age. Through realtime video streams and an interactive chat, Creatr strives to provide students with the tools they need to succeed. If you are trying to access a course or one of our free live streams, please login now. If you do not already have an account you can create one for free by clicking the “register” button.</p>
        <h4>Who am I?</h4>
        <p>My name is Daniel Whiteside, CEO and founder of Creatr. I am very excited to announce the launching of creatrclasses.com and the online classes we will be able to provide – this landmark means a lot to me personally as well as for education as a whole. I have personally worked as a tutor, test prep instructor, and educational coach since 2011, and even way back then I knew online educational platforms would change the way people learn. Now I get to be part of that process and contribute something important to my field. </p>
      	<h4> My Philosophy </h4>
      	<p>One of the pillars in my application of educational techniques is based on Self-Regulated Learning theory – ultimately the aim of SRL is to teach students the metacognitive skills required for academic success. As students transition to high school and college, a greater degree of self regulation is required to match the increase in responsibility and cognitive workloads associated with higher education. Generally this mean getting the students involved in the process identifying learning goals, creating action plans, and analyzing the effectiveness of the implemented plan. </p>
      	<h4>What Creatr Offers - SAT and ACT Preperation</h4>
      	<p>Creatr currently offers rich and interactive SAT and ACT prep courses – courses that in the past have helped my students get the scores they need to pursue a meaningful college career. The test prep classes we offer start at the “ground level,” addressing first why these tests exist and how they are used by colleges, and proceeding to an overview of the importance that motivation and goal-setting play in preparing for such a difficult test. Once the student understands why the test is used, how it works, and their individual test score goals, we will proceed to an overview of the test content for each section. 
</p>
      	<p>Be sure to check out our free weekly live SAT & ACT Question and Answer sessions on Thursdays at 8:00pm CST. I will spend about 30-45 minutes answering any questions that come up from the audience each week, completely for free! All you have to do is register for a free account, and then log in on Thursday nights for the broadcasts. If you'd like to ask your questions in advance, send an email with the subject line “SAT & ACT Question and Answer on (date of broadcast)” to my email address listed at the bottom of this page. I will answer as many questions as I can get to in the allotted time.</p>
      	<p>A variety of educational content including tutoring help for AP math and science classes, standardized test prep, college coaching, and goal setting workshops will be coming soon – but for right now, Creatr is still just getting off the ground. Check back soon as we continue to add site features, additional courses and even free content! I intend to pilot online Pre-Calculus, Calculus, and AP Physics live tutoring sessions within the next couple of months. Stay tuned for the updates and make sure you sign up for a free account to get on the mailing list! We are still in the process of building our online platform and growing our customer base, and since we are still in the beginning stages of our operation we love to hear comments and questions from our customers. If you have any comments, requests for courses, or comments about what we do, please send us an email!</p>
      	<p>Thank you and I hope to see you in class soon!
